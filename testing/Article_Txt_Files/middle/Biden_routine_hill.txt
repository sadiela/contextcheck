President Biden has joined the scores of people who turned to Mario Kart to stay entertained during the pandemic — at least for one game with his granddaughter.   

Naomi Biden posted on Snapchat this weekend that she and her grandfather played an arcade-style game round of Mario Kart at Camp David over the weekend — and that he won.

"Secret Service made an exception and let him drive himself!" Naomi Biden, who is 27, wrote on the photo, adding: "A little rusty but he still won (barely)."

The Mario Kart match took place during Biden's first weekend at Camp David as president. It was not confirmed which character Biden played as during the game, though it seems his screen may show Luigi.  


Nintendo, which makes Mario Kart, reported earlier this month that its profits have soared during the pandemic as people are forced to find ways to pass time at home. The company said that among its most popular games have been Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and Super Mario 3D All-Stars. 

Naomi Biden also posted on Twitter that the family had given the president some Valentine's Day and Presidents Day holiday "swag."

The photo shows Biden in a Camp David hat that reads "pop" on the back. 


 

Biden's weekend at the mountain retreat in western Maryland wasn't all fun and games though. 
A White House official confirmed to reporters last week that Biden was also scheduled to meet with his national security advisers on Saturday.
