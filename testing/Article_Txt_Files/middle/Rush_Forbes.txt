The talk show host Rush Limbaugh, an influential fixture of the right for decades, died Wednesday morning at the age of 70 from lung cancer, according to his family.
Limbaugh’s wife Kathryn announced his death on his radio show, saying he passed away from lung cancer complications Wednesday morning in his Palm Beach, Florida home.

The long-time host of the “Rush Limbaugh Show” learned he had a “terminal diagnosis” of Stage IV lung cancer in January of last year and was shortly thereafter given the Presidential Medal of Freedom from former President Trump, of whom he was a great supporter.

Limbaugh had been absent from his show for the past two weeks as he underwent cancer treatment.

He had warned his listeners in October that his health was going in the “wrong direction.”
Limbaugh has been one of the leading voices of the conservative movement since he launched his nationally syndicated midday radio show in 1988, boasting an audience of 15 million at the show’s peak. Though widely considered one of the country’s most influential commercial broadcasters, Limbaugh was far from universally loved, leaving behind a polarizing legacy. His crude and provocative style earned him a large and loyal following, but also left many offended, with his commentary on race and gender particularly divisive. Limbaugh is widely considered to be monumental in shaping the modern Republican Party.
