Rush Limbaugh, a pioneer in popularizing right-wing talk radio, has died at the age of 70 after a months-long battle with lung cancer.
Fox News reports that Limbaugh's death was announced by wife Kathryn Limbaugh during his radio show.

Limbaugh rose to prominence during the 1990s when he grew popular for his attacks on then-President Bill Clinton, going so far as to call then-12-year-old first daughter Chelsea Clinton the "White House dog."
Limbaugh was also a staunch defender of former President Donald Trump, who would give the right-wing host the Medal of Freedom during his final State of the Union address last year.
"Rush Limbaugh: Thank you for your decades of tireless devotion to our country," Trump said at the time.
Limbaugh was first diagnosed with Stage IV lung cancer in January 2020. He would continue broadcasting up until the first week of February 2021.
